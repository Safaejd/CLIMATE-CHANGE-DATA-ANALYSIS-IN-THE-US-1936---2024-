# 🌍 Climate Change Data Analysis in the US (1936–2024)

## 📚 Project Overview
This project analyzes historical weather data from 1936 to 2024 across four US regions:
- **Alaska:** Barrow Airport  
- **Boston, MA:** Logan Airport  
- **California:** Downtown Station (Los Angeles)  
- **Florida:** Apalachicola Airport  

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify long-term temperature trends and anomalies  
- Analyze extreme weather events and seasonal variations  
- Forecast future trends to assess climate risks  

## 📊 Data & Sources
- **Dataset:** [NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets)  
- **Key Variables:** TMAX, TMIN, TAVG, AWND, WSFG, DP01, DP10  

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- `pandas` | `matplotlib` | `seaborn` | `numpy`  
- `sklearn.linear_model` | `statsmodels.tsa.arima.model`  

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Boston:** Rising temperatures, fewer cold days, and increased heatwave frequency.  
- **Alaska:** Significant warming trend with declining snowfall.  
- **California:** Increased heat events and worsening drought variability.  
- **Florida:** Higher cooling demand and increased wind variability linked to hurricanes.  

## 🔮 Forecasts & Implications
- Gradual temperature increase across all regions.  
- Higher frequency of extreme heat and fewer cold days.  
- Stabilized precipitation trends, with regional variability.
